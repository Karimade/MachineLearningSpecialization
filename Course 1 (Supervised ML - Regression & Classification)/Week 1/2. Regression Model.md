# Linear Regression Model:
- Fitting a straight line to the data to predict new data inputs
- It is a regression model because it predicts numbers as the output.
- Any model that predicts numbers as output is addressing what is called a `Regression Problem`.
- Linear regression is one of the regression models ,but there is other models that addresses the regression problem too.

 ## Regression vs Classification models
 - Regression models predicts possibly an infinite numbers of output
 - Classification models predicts a discrete finite set of outputs ex(Cate,Dog).

 ## Training Set Notation
- The data that is used to train the model is called `Training Set`.
- The inputs usually called `x, features, input features`.
- The outputs usually called `y, output, target`,
- The number of training examples(rows) is called `m`
- ![Training set](/Images/TrainingSet.png)

## Model Training Process
- The training process happens by feeds the model with the training set (inputs (features) and outputs (targets))  to the learning algorithm , then the learning algorithm will produce a function (the model) that will take the input(x) and produce an estimate or a prediction `y-hat`

## Cost Function:
- It tells how good the model is performing.
- The goal is to minimize it as possible.
### Model Parameters(W and B) :
- `y = wx + b`, `w` and `b` are the model parameters, we change them until the line fits our data well then it should
be ready to predict real data `y-hat`.
- look how the values of w and b parameters changing the line

### How well the line fits the training data
- To see how good our model is performing, we use the cost function
- It measures the gap between the predicted values and the actual true values.
- the most widly used cost function is the `Squared Error Cost Function` shown in the photo.
- ![Squared Error Cost Function](/Images/ModelParameters.png)
- ![Cost Function Values Example](/Images/CostFunctionExamplePlot.png)
- So the role of the linear regression model is to find the values of `w` and `b` that results in the lowest value of the cost function `J(w,b)`.
